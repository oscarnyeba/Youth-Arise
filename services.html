                    <h3>Are peer counselors really trained?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Every peer counselor completes 40+ hours of training covering active listening, mental health basics, crisis assessment, cultural sensitivity, and ethical boundaries. They receive ongoing supervision from licensed mental health
                        professionals.

                    <h3>What if I need professional therapy?</h3>
                    <p>Peer counselors can help with many challenges, but they're not a replacement for professional therapy. If you need clinical treatment, we'll connect you with affordable or free mental health professionals in your area.</p>

                    <h3>What happens in a peer counseling session?</h3>
                    <p>You talk, your counselor listens. There's no judgment or advice-giving. Together, you'll explore what you're experiencing, identify your strengths, and consider your options. You're always in control of what you share.</p>

                    <h3>Can I see the same counselor multiple times?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Many people build ongoing relationships with their peer counselors. You can request the same person for future sessions if you felt a good connection.</p>
