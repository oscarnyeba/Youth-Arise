                    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
                    <p>Youth Arise began in 2020 when a group of university students noticed something troubling: their friends were struggling with anxiety, depression, and stress, but few felt comfortable seeking help. The stigma around mental health created
                        invisible barriers that left too many young people suffering in silence.</p>
                    <p>What started as informal peer support circles in campus study rooms has grown into a comprehensive mental health initiative serving thousands of students across Uganda. We realized that sometimes, the most powerful support comes not
                        from professionals in white coats, but from peers who truly understand what you're going through.</p>
                    <p>Today, Youth Arise connects young people with trained peer counselors, evidence-based resources, and a community that breaks down the walls of isolation. We're building a generation that talks openly about mental health, supports one
                        another without judgment, and knows where to turn when life gets overwhelming.</p>

                <p class="section-subtitle">The principles at the heart of everything we do</p>
            </div>

                    <h3>Peer-Driven Support</h3>
                    <p>We believe young people are the experts on their own experiences. Our peer-to-peer model creates authentic connections that professional settings sometimes can't match. When someone who's been through similar struggles offers support,
                        healing happens.</p>
                </div>

                    <div class="value-icon">🔒</div>
                    <h3>Confidentiality Always</h3>
                    <p>Trust is everything. We maintain strict confidentiality in all our services, creating safe spaces where young people can share their struggles without fear of judgment, gossip, or unwanted disclosure to parents or schools.</p>

                    <h3>Evidence-Based Approach</h3>
                    <p>While our delivery is peer-to-peer, our methods are grounded in proven mental health practices. Every peer counselor receives professional training in active listening, crisis assessment, and when to refer to clinical professionals.</p>

                    <h3>Accessible for All</h3>
                    <p>Mental health support shouldn't depend on your family's income. All our services—from peer counseling to workshops to crisis support—are completely free. We meet young people where they are, both physically and emotionally.</p>

                    <div class="value-icon">💪</div>
                    <h3>Strength-Focused</h3>
                    <p>We don't see young people as problems to be fixed. Every person has inherent strengths and resilience. Our role is to help individuals recognize and build on what's already working, even in their darkest moments.</p>

                    <h3>Prevention Matters</h3>
                    <p>While crisis support is crucial, we're equally committed to prevention. Our workshops teach coping skills, emotional regulation, and how to recognize warning signs in yourself and friends before things reach a breaking point.</p>
